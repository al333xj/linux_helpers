NOPE IT DON'T WORK

From: https://www.fosslinux.com/1124/facebook-messenger-for-ubuntu-linux-mint-and-fedora.htm
Download https://github.com/Aluxian/Messenger-for-Desktop/releases -  messengerfordesktop-2.0.9-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i ./messengerfordesktop-2.0.9-linux-amd64.deb
I also had to do
sudo apt-get install gconf2 beforehand

FRANZ - it works
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/franz_5.6.1_amd64.deb
