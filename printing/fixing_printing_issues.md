# Rendering completed


## Issue

Printer Brother-HL-L2350DW's Status is "Rendering completed"; however, nothing is printed.

## To fix

I went to Settings -> Devices -> Printers, and removed the printer.

It automatically found Brother_HL-L2350DW_series. That has the message "Does not accept jobs" and comes up on the print dialogue as Status = "Rejecting jobs."

I clicked the green "Add" button and selected the HL-L2350DW. Now there is one printer, HL-L2350DW, it says "Ready".
