## HOW TO FORMAT SD CARD TO FAT32

# https://ragnyll.gitlab.io/2018/05/22/format-a-sd-card-to-fat-32linux.html

# find SD card
sudo fdisk -l 


# here mine is /dev/mmcblk0
# it's obvious because of the size
# DON'T REFORMAT THE FILE SYSTEM

# next enter fdisk
fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

# delete the existing partition
d

# check the partition is deleted
p

# create a new partition (accept default size params is fine)
n
# make it primary
p

# make it partition 1
1

# make it FAT32 (might not have this option)
b

# if don't have the above option (change type), then b
t
b

# write the changes
w


# MAY need to restart the computer at this point
# if you do, make sure that when you're calling mkfs.vfat later
# that you have the correct partition
# -v is for verbose
# -c checks for bad blocks - optional and slow, but good 
# if you have corrupted data on the original partition
 mkfs.vfat -v -c /dev/mmcblk0p1
