Adding text overlays in kdenlive

- add video clip as you'd usually do, but not to the topmost track (usually track 3). Track 1 or 2 is OK
- where you'd right click to Add Clip, instead right click to Add Title Clip
- create the text, I usually do this in white and then also create a black rectangle for the white text to sit on top
- don't forget to set the timing of this to however long you want the title clip to set there
- and then render/export as usually
